        American football is a tough, physical game requiring a wide range of attributes including explosive power, strength, agility, speed, and physical and mental toughness. The huge collisions and intricate plays involving the 22 players on the field are what make the sport the spectacle that it is.
        Games can take up to 3 hours to complete and can look quite complex, largely because each play is often highly tactical. In reality football is actually a relatively easy sport to follow and enjoy. It is the complexities of the sport, gained from years of avid watching, which make the game so interesting to watch and make it more than a test of brute strength and muscle. Also referred to as American football, as distinct from football (or soccer as it is also known.) In some countries, American football is often referred to as gridiron or gridiron football to differentiate it from other football games.
